    "For my project, I am most interested in applying imaging spectroscopy data in some way which is applicable to Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). A possible example of a physical model could be one that attempts to model SWE based on surface reflectance data. Given my lack of remote sensing experience, I do not know whether a snow variable such as grain size could possibly be used as a proxy for SWE, since I know that grain size affects reflectance. If grain size is more relevant to snow albedo rather than SWE, perhaps there is some sort of reflectance data I could use to measure snow depth as a valid proxy for SWE. As I continue to explore possible ideas for my class project, landscape attributes that I am most interested are likely going to be grain size, snow depth, snow extent, and of course SWE."
